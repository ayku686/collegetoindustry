The platform intends to solve these problems:
Accessibility of Indian students to the employers is limited and the students don’t know the pathway to getting into the top companies.
The employers need good employees but they don’t get what they search for because of lack of connection between the two. In this case both the good students and employers are at big loss as one misses a good company and other misses a good employee.
There is a gap between the mentors and industry professionals and the students. The students are not able to get education from the mentors who are best in their fields because of this gap. There is no platform now as such which can reduce this gap.

These are a few screenshots of the app
